# Police-Database
CS 3520 - Midterm project that creates a base level Police Database. 

This project involves the creation of a simulated law enforcement database, designed to replicate the complexities and 
interconnections found in real-world data management systems. Its primary purpose is to provide a detailed and practical 
understanding of how relational databases function. By encompassing various elements such as police officers, suspects, 
crimes, crime scenes, and evidence, the database offers a comprehensive framework for organizing and querying data.
